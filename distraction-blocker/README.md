# Distraction Blocker Chrome Extension

This extension helps you stay focused by blocking distracting websites and redirecting you to a list of productive sites that you curate.

## How to Install

1.  Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
2.  Enable **"Developer mode"** using the toggle switch in the top-right corner.
3.  Click the **"Load unpacked"** button that appears.
4.  In the file selection dialog, choose the `distraction-blocker` directory that contains this `README.md` file.
5.  The extension should now be loaded and active! You will see its icon in the Chrome toolbar.

## How to Use

### Blocking a Site
- When you are on a site you want to block, click the extension's icon in the toolbar and click the **"Block this site"** button.

### Building Your Productive "Reading List"
- When you are on a site you'd like to be redirected to in the future, click the extension's icon and click the **"Add to Productive List"** button.

### Managing Your Lists
- To see and manage all your blocked and productive sites, right-click the extension icon and select **"Options"**, or click the "Settings" link in the popup. This will open a page where you can manually add or remove sites from both lists.

### How it Works
- Once a site is on your block list, navigating to it will automatically redirect you to one of the sites from your "Productive Sites" list.
